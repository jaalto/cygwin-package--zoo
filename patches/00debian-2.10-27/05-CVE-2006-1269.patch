Subject: Buffer overflow during archive creation CVE-2006-1269

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=183426

A buffer overflow bug exists in zoo which is triggered during archive
creation. This issue is borderline a bug as it's really only a
problem if someone is creating a zoo archive on a directory full of
files controlled by a local attacker.
