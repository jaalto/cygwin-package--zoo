zoo
------------------------------------------

Manipulate zoo archives

Zoo is used to create and maintain collections of files in compressed
form. It uses a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm that gives space
savings in the range of 20% to 80% depending on the type of file data.
Zoo can store and selectively extract multiple generations of the same
file.
